# 📈 Simple Linear Regression

This project implements **Simple Linear Regression**, a basic supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous value based on one independent variable.

The model finds the best-fit straight line between input (X) and output (Y) using the equation:

y = mx + b

Where:
* **m** = slope of the line
* **b** = intercept
* **x** = input feature
* **y** = predicted value
